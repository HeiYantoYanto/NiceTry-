                <p>Tree data structures are hierarchical, consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single root node at the top and child nodes branching out. Each node can have zero or more children, but only one parent. Trees are non-linear, allowing for efficient organization and retrieval of data. Binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees, and heaps are common variants. Trees excel in representing hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, organizational charts, or decision processes. They support efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, often with logarithmic time complexity (e.g., O(log n) in balanced trees). Trees are also the backbone of advanced data structures like databases and search engines. However, they require careful balancing to maintain performance and can be complex to implement. Their ability to model nested relationships makes them indispensable in computer science.
