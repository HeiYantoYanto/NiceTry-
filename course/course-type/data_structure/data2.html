                <p>Linear data structures organize elements in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a linear progression. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and strings. In these structures, elements are arranged in a specific order, and traversal typically occurs in a single pass from one element to the next. Arrays provide constant-time access but fixed size, while linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation but slower access. Stacks and queues are abstract types that enforce LIFO and FIFO disciplines, respectively. Linear structures are fundamental for tasks like sorting, searching, and managing data sequences. They are efficient for certain operations but may lack flexibility for complex relationships. Their simplicity makes them ideal for applications where data needs to be processed in a straightforward, ordered fashion, such as in parsing expressions, managing function calls, or handling task scheduling.
